- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jchemistry
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in **displaying graphs** in obsidian (**xy-like** graphs mainly to draw vectors)
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently studying chemistry, so Im not a programmer or someone with similar knowledge that can easily approach code. I'm learning just now LaTex, and I'd like to implement pgf/tikz (like the txt file you can export from geogebra). Is that even possibile?
- ðŸ“« How to reach me ... (jacopo.panseri@mail.com)
Thanks for your time!
